# dev-maven-mockito-example
Development project which is an example for mockito


This example project demonstrates the use of mockito and junit framework.

It is very simple project which does not connect to db or any other proxy services, but depends on other interface's implementation.

So basically mockito mocks the results of the implementations for testing the particular level of code. 

The lowest level contains only the junit test case.

This project is completely written by following TDD(Test Driven Development) approach.

TDD is very easy and makes your logic to function 100%. It ensures you deliver a highly reliable code and i suggest every programmer to follow it. 

In my case it actually reduces the time of debugging and hence at total you can deliver a high quality code at very fast time.
